# survey-macros

The macro consists of a number of subroutines to automate the finishing of survey camp spreadsheets. Specific function of each sub routine is discussed below:

1:Printable_MarginSet_Papersize()

This subroutine changes the margin to concerned spacings as mentioned in standards set by survey committee.It also sets papersize to A4. So make sure that you run this macro only to spreadsheets that are to be printed in A4 size. Otherwise, you can run the macro and then change the papersize to A3 manually.

2: save as pdf

This saves the worksheet to pdf file  which will named after name of worksheet. Make sure you edit this macro with concerned file path. For an apt  destination, I  created a folder in desktop where the concerned pdf files were saved.

3. Column_Width_Fly Levelling

A number of worksheets were needed to be filled for fly levelling. In absence of this macro, we would need to change column width manually for each worksheet which would be too tedious and tiring.Running this macro for each sheet will very much speeden the process.

4. Column_Width_Fly Levelling

It is similar to  subroutine "Column_Width_Fly Levelling." Given the number of detailing sheets to be filled, this would help in getting desired formatting standards  quickly.

Note: 
The sheets used for filling the data should be the standard one so that the column width macro gives desired output. Don't waste your time creating the format. I am attaching the workbook with all dataentry formats in it.
